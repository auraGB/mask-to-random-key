# Mask-To-Random-Key
This program will take a mask and generate a random key which could be used as a unique identifier 
##Some More Infomation
This program is just a prototype for something which could be used as a key redeemtion program such as activating a licence key, this makes it easy 
for the vendor as the mask can be set to what ever you want it to be, to go further with this i could make sure the key is not generated twise as 
this would not be good if this was being used in the real world.
